/* The semaphore provides two main operations: sem_post adds a token to the
   semaphore; sem_wait grabs a token from the semaphore, potentially waiting
   until there is a token available.  A sem_wait needs to synchronize with
   the sem_post that provided the token, so that whatever lead to the sem_post
   happens before the code after sem_wait.

   Conceptually, available tokens can simply be counted; let's call that the
   value of the semaphore.  However, we also want to know whether there might
   be a sem_wait that is blocked on the value because it was zero (using a
   futex with the value being the futex variable); if there is no blocked
   sem_wait, sem_post does not need to execute a futex_wake call.  Therefore,
   we also need to count the number of potentially blocked sem_wait calls
   (which we call nwaiters).

   What makes this tricky is that POSIX requires that a semaphore can be
   destroyed as soon as the last remaining sem_wait has returned, and no
   other sem_wait or sem_post calls are executing concurrently.  However, the
   sem_post call whose token was consumed by the last sem_wait is considered
   to have finished once it provided the token to the sem_wait.
   Thus, sem_post must not access the semaphore struct anymore after it has
   made a token available; IOW, it needs to be able to atomically provide
   a token and check whether any blocked sem_wait calls might exist.

   This is straightforward to do if the architecture provides 64b atomics
   because we can just put both the value and nwaiters into one variable that
   we access atomically: This is the data field, the value is in the
   least-significant 32 bits, and nwaiters in the other bits.  When sem_post
   makes a value available, it can atomically check nwaiters.

   If we have only 32b atomics available, we cannot put both nwaiters and
   value into one 32b value because then we might have too few bits for both
   of those counters.  Therefore, we need to use two distinct fields.

   To allow sem_post to atomically make a token available and check for
   blocked sem_wait calls, we use one bit in value to indicate whether
   nwaiters is nonzero.  That allows sem_post to use basically the same
   algorithm as with 64b atomics, but requires sem_wait to update the bit; it
   can't do this atomically with another access to nwaiters, but it can compute
   a conservative value for the bit because it's benign if the bit is set
   even if nwaiters is zero (all we get is an unnecessary futex wake call by
   sem_post).
   Specifically, sem_wait will unset the bit speculatively if it believes that
   there is no other concurrently executing sem_wait.  If it misspeculated,
   it will have to clean up by waking any other sem_wait call (i.e., what
   sem_post would do otherwise).  This does not conflict with the destruction
   requirement because the semaphore must not be destructed while any sem_wait
   is still executing.  */

   documentation, lll_futex_wake can return -EINTR only if interrupted by a

	     EINTR could be either due to being interrupted by a signal, or

	     Retrying on EINTR is technically always allowed because to
	     reliably interrupt sem_wait with a signal, the signal handler

     We work around incorrectly unsetting the nwaiters bit by letting sem_wait
     set the bit again and waking the number of waiters that could grab a
     token.  There are two additional properties we need to ensure:
     (1) We make sure that whenever unsetting the bit, we see the increment of
     nwaiters by the other thread that set the bit.  IOW, we will notice if
     we make a mistake.
     (2) When setting the nwaiters bit, we make sure that we see the unsetting
     of the bit by another waiter that happened before us.  This avoids having
     to blindly set the bit whenever we need to block on it.  We set/unset
     the bit while having incremented nwaiters (i.e., are a registered
     waiter), and the problematic case only happens when one waiter indeed
     followed another (i.e., nwaiters was never larger than 1); thus, this
     works similarly as with a critical section using nwaiters (see the MOs
     and related comments below).
